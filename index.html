<p><em>The Book of Liberty</em> is a collection of essays written by anons who follow political (or otherwise) philosphies broadly classifiable as (for lack of a better word) Libertarian. This includes Anarcho-Capitalists, Capitalist Minarchists, Objectivists, and some Monarchists.</p>

<p>Because the essays span across different ideologies, you should not correlate them unless they belong to the same category.</p>
